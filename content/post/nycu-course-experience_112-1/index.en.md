## Logic Design
> Course ID: 515110  
> Type: Required  
> Instructor: Zhang Tianxuan  
> Department: Electrical Engineering  
- Insights
    - The professor is very serious, and manages the pace of the lecture slides well, but somehow the course progressed very quickly and ended two weeks early.
    - Quizzes were not too difficult, slightly easier than the homework, with only a few challenging questions.
    - There was an extra credit assignment involving Verilog on HDLBits, just solving some easy problems for extra points.
    - Generally, as long as you do the homework and pay attention in class, it's not hard to get a good grade.
    - The latter part of the course was a bit more challenging and required some extra effort to prepare.
    - This course, like Digital Circuit Design, should not be taken by Computer Science students; the department office said it cannot be counted, and I was the fool.

## Introduction to Computers and Programming
> Course ID: 515502  
> Type: Required  
> Instructor: Huang Jingqun  
> Department: Common Information  
- Insights
    - Although this course is titled Introduction to Computers and Programming, it mainly teaches programming, and the exams are practical programming tests.
    - The professor's teaching pace is oddly slow, with the teaching assistants covering pointers while he was still on loops.
    - The teaching assistant's English was not very good, but slides were available on e3, which you could study on your own.
    - Each week's practical session generally involved the teaching assistant reading through the slides, followed by up to three practice problems for everyone to work on.
    - The latter half of the course included an Online Judge (OJ), but it was either crashing or took forever to return results, so don't get your hopes up.
    - The course forced the use of Visual Studio, which cannot be installed on MacOS; although the teaching assistant seemed to offer alternatives, homework grades were either based on OJ results or run on the teaching assistant's Visual Studio, and if it didn't run, you got zero.
    - Practical exams still required the use of computers in the computer center, so it's necessary to familiarize yourself with how to use Visual Studio.
    - During practical exams, you could download the slides and your previous code before starting, but some questions were a bit harder.
    - Due to a below-average midterm score, the professor decided to give everyone a fresh start, and the highest two of three practical exams would count as midterm and final exam grades.
    - Classroom attendance contributed to the total grade, adding up to 6 points; if only I had known to attend all the classes.

## Linear Algebra
> Course ID: 515503  
> Type: Required  
> Instructor: Yi Zhiwei  
> Department: Common Information  
- Insights
    - The professor is very approachable for discussion, although the course pace is really slow and often didn't cover all the material before exams.
    - Possibly because he knew he often couldn't finish, there were online recorded lectures available on e3 for self-study.
    - The classroom was always full before roll call, but attendance dropped by half after.
    - The teaching assistant was excellent and very considerate of the students, and apparently very straightforward when asked for grade adjustments.
    - Each quiz had a maximum score of 50, with the highest four of the first five quizzes plus the average of the sixth quiz counting towards the exam grades.
    - Grading was typically all-or-nothing, which required careful attention to avoid careless mistakes.
    - It was beneficial to thoroughly work through the exercises in the textbook, and remember to check the discussion forum set up by the professor as some quiz questions were drawn from there.

    - Practical labs, if attended, are typically easy to ace and quite enjoyable.
        - Lab1: Wireshark tutorial and packet capturing practice.
        - Lab2: Making network cables, remember to install the sleeve before crimping the cable, or you'll end up with two movable sleeves.
