## Fundamentals of Music Training
> **SOS Project 2024**  
> Course Number: 010028  
> Type: Core Curriculum 
> Instructor: Wen-Wan Chen (Chung Yuan Christian University)  
> Department: Liberal Arts College  

- Experience
  - The course content is manageable for those with basic knowledge of music, covering topics from basic musical elements to notation, scales, and more. Overall, it is not difficult.
  - There were two assignments: the first involved simple transcription between number notation and staff notation, and the second focused on identifying scales.
  - The final exam primarily covered class content, with some emphasis on scales. There were one or two questions slightly outside the syllabus, but finding the answers was straightforward.
  - The professor provided all materials and exam content upfront, allowing students to complete everything in one afternoon if desired.
  - The final grade seemed unexpectedly low, possibly due to one missed live class, attended online instead.
  - This year, the SOS project shifted to a pass-fail system, reducing the stress of taking online courses and minimizing the impact of grades.
